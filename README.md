## Hi there 👋

**Blockchain & Full-Stack Developer** | Specializing in **Ethereum**, **ZK Proofs**, **Smart Contracts**, and **Decentralized Systems**

I'm passionate about building secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving applications in Web3. Currently focused on **zero-knowledge** tech and modular smart contract patterns.

- **Solidity** — Smart contracts, EIP standards (especially EIP-2535 Diamonds), DeFi protocols
- **Rust** — High-performance blockchain components, Substrate/Polkadot, zk-SNARK circuits **+ backend development** (REST/GraphQL APIs, web servers, relayers, indexers, off-chain services using frameworks like Axum, Actix, or Rocket)
- **TypeScript** — Front-end dApps, ethers.js/web3.js integrations, Next.js/React apps
- **Python** — Scripting, data analysis, back-end tools, zk proof prototyping (e.g., with libraries like py-evm or zk libs)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK)** — zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs, privacy layers, rollups, verifiable computation
- **Technical Writing** — Clear documentation, blog posts, tutorials on blockchain/ZK concepts

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Building a **full-stack template** for **EIP-2535** (Diamond Standard) — modular, upgradeable smart contracts with front-end + backend integration
- Deepening expertise in **ZK proofs** — exploring zk-rollups, privacy-preserving apps, and circuit design (including Rust implementations)

### 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring
- Advanced **ZK** techniques (circom, halo2, snarkjs, zk-STARKs)
- Rust-based blockchain frameworks (e.g., Solana/Anchor, Polkadot/Substrate)
- Rust backend patterns for Web3 (high-throughput servers, async APIs, secure endpoints)
- Core Ethereum tooling and infrastructure

### 📫 Let's Connect
- **X / Twitter**: [@BAbraham_92](https://x.com/BAbraham_92)
- Open to collaborations on ZK projects, smart contracts, modular Ethereum tooling, or Rust-based backend infrastructure!
